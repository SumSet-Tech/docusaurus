# Mintr Overview
Let's discover **Mintr in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started
Get started by **creating a new collection**.

Then **create a new NFT**, or **import files** from your device, or **download a minted collection**.

## Create a new collection
Go to the [Collections page](https://mintr.nftr.pro/collections/).


Click **+ New Collection**. 

Add a title and description if you want, and click **OK**.

A new Collection will be added to the top of the page.

Click **Edit** to open the collection in the Collection Editor.


## Create NFTs
There are three ways to create new NFTs.
1. **Create a new NFT** and add details in the editor
2. **Import files**, with or without metadata
3. **Download a minted collection**


### Create a new NFT

Select **Scan / Import Directory**.

A popup will appear. Click **Browse...** and select the folder with all your files in it.

Click **Upload** to start the import process. 

*Note: Mintr doesn't upload files at this point. The browser thinks anything selecting files is "Uploading".*

Mintr will scan through the files in the folder, and will provide powerful importing options.

Choose the options in the Scan / Import Directory view, and then click **Import**

In the Collection Editor, go to: **Collection > Process**.
