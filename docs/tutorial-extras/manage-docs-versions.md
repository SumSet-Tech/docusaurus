# Performance Tips

## Firefox Browser
Mintr works on all browsers, but currently, it's much faster with Firefox. 


## Disk space
Mintr stores imported data using IndexedDB, a browser-based database standard.

The browser will be able to use half of the available disk space for imported data. 

If you have a large collection, make sure you have enough space. 

## Use Scan instead of Import
If you have a large collection it may not be possible to import all the assets.

When importing files, you are given a choice to Ignore, Scan, Import, or Convert.

If you choose Scan instead of Import, the assets will still be usable when uploading and minting.

The only time files need to be imported, are when you want to use them for a thumbnail reference in Mintr.
