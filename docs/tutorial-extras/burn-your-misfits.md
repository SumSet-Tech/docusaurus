# Burn Your Misfits
Ideally, you checked your work before you committed them to the Chia Blockchain. Here are the steps to follow if you messed up.

## Removing Duplicates

1. Identify all NFTs that have duplicates
2. Identify the first NFT of the duplicates to be minted (can be determined by the "Minted at Blockheight" field). Mark down the NFT ID of this one as it is the one you want to keep.
3. Note down all other NFT ids that are duplicates separately to note those are the ones to be burned.
4. We recommend moving the ones to be burned to a different DID (this will let you verify once more that the NFTs are in the correct did and no other duplicates exist)
5. Send all duplicates to the burn address (can be done in bulk using the multi-select in the GUI, this is also why moving the duplicates to a different did is very helpful)
