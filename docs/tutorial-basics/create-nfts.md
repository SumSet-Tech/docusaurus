# Create NFTs
There are three ways to create new NFTs.
1. **Create a new NFT** and add details in the editor
2. **Import files**, with or without metadata
3. **Download a minted collection**


## Create a new NFT
In the Collection Editor, create a new NFT by clicking **+ New NFT**.


## Import files

In the Collection Editor, go to: **Collection > Process**.

Select **Scan / Import Directory**.

A popup will appear. Click **Browse...** and select the folder with all your files in it.

Click **Upload** to start the import process.

*Note: Mintr doesn't upload files at this point. The browser thinks anything selecting files is "Uploading".*

Mintr will scan through the files in the folder, and will provide powerful importing options.

Choose the options in the Scan / Import Directory view, and then click **Import**


## Download a minted collection

In the Collection Editor, go to: **Collection > Process**.

Select **Download Minted Collection**.

Add the **Collection ID** for the collection you want to download.

Click **Import** to start the downloading process.
