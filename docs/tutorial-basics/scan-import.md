# Import Files

## Import files from your device

In the Collection Editor, go to: **Collection > Process**.

Select **Scan / Import Directory**.

A popup will appear. Click **Browse...** and select the folder with all your files in it.

Click **Upload** to start the import process.

*Note: Mintr doesn't upload files at this point. The browser thinks anything selecting files is "Uploading".*

Mintr will scan through the files in the folder, and will provide powerful importing options.

Choose the options in the Scan / Import Directory view, and then click **Import**
